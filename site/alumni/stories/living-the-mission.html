<p>Class of 2000</p>
<p><strong>UWC has taught me never to categorise people and make judgements based on generalisations.</strong></p>
<p>Anders B&oslash;tter (UWCMC 98-00) runs a film production company, Dynamofilm in Copenhagen and works for the Danish Broadcast Corporation. He is also is studying Film Studies at Copenhagen University. In 2008, he created the project &ldquo;Undskyld Muhammed&rdquo; (&ldquo;Sorry Muhammad&rdquo;), which has received much media attention. The project has a group page on Facebook and a webpage www.undskyldmuhammed.dk. He views this as one of his greatest achievements and in May 2008, won an Al Mahabba Award for the project.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an attempt to create a more plural debate about the Danish cartoons of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), without stigmatising Muslims in Denmark and abroad. The project&#39;s main motto claims that &ldquo;one does not need to denigrate that which is holy to others to emphasize the sanctity of the freedom of speech&rdquo;. The very clear cut message about the importance of building bridges of dialogue and compromise between the Arab and the Western world, instead of burning them, was directly inspired by my UWC education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anders returned to Denmark after graduating from UWC Mahindra College and founded record and film store Moby Disc in his hometown of Svendborg. Anders has worked on numerous film projects since 2005. His Salem music video,&ldquo;The Needle In The Butterfly&rdquo; won the Hugo Award at Copenhagen University in 2007 and will be broadcast on television programmes in Germany and Mexico . He was actively involved with the Danish National Committee from 2000 until 2008. He was head of selection from 2005-2007 and was active in building up a stronger network for UWC Alumni in Denmark, &ldquo;A very very exciting task which has paid off; Our activities have doubled and our alumni network is now stronger than ever,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Anders found out about UWC through a poster in his local high school. &ldquo;UWC was a welcome challenge for me....the teaching and learning at UWC seemed more engaging, more relevant and more inspiring than my previous high school experience, and the seriousness of the academic material was way above what I had been used to in any other school systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I discovered my passion for filmmaking and creative writing at UWC. The combination of studying the I.B. whilst discovering your own creative potential was indeed a very powerful and mindblowing experience. Also, I learned that hard academic work and achievements also can contain great elements of creativity - a knowledge I have definitely carried with me into my professional career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;UWC has taught me never to categorise people and make judgements based on generalisations. Therefore, one could say that I now always look for &ldquo;the opinion - and the other opinion&rdquo; in every aspect of my life. Hence my entire approach towards my surroundings changed because of my UWC education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I see it, diversity will always release personal potential. The cultural diversity of any UWC school is immense. For me this diversity sparked a potential, which may not have been released in the same constructive and meaningful manner if I had not attended a UWC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot emphasise enough how much it is &ldquo;the small experiences&rdquo; at UWC that help shape a young person and his/hers future. At UWC you can sign up for a vast number of activities, take on enormous academic challenges and create life-saving services. But as I see it, these grand and relevant opportunities are just a small piece of the UWC education. What is really important to be aware of are all of the hundreds of little cross-cultural experiences that takes place every hour of each day in the dorms of the UWC colleges, in the dining hall, in the libraries, at the sports facilities and in the classrooms. The creation of a miniature world and a 100% international society within it is something you cannot &ldquo;sign up for&rdquo; in any other school system in the world. It is a unique experience, which everyday gives young people the chance to build a world that is more united, starting with their own exceptional example.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>I have always had a desire to be involved in international aid work and being at UWC made me aware that I needed some practical skills to be of any use in this field</strong></p>
<p>Rosie Spooner from the UK attended UWC Mahindra College from 2001 to 2003. She studied Medicine at St. George&rsquo;s University of London and now works at National Health Service.</p>
<p>Since 2004, Rosie has been involved with running her University society, Student Action for Refugees, an organisation which aims to support vulnerable refugees in the local South London area. Since she began working with StAR they have developed a weekly children&rsquo;s after school club, established links with social workers, gained funding and volunteer support. The organisation now run trips, holidays and mentoring projects for over 60 families and support 120 children. Rosie&rsquo;s roles within the StAR committee have ranged from volunteer to advocacy coordinator. In 2008 she was awarded a Student Union prize in recognition of her commitment and in 2009 received the Lord Mayor&#39;s Dragon Award for Volunteer of the Year. Her involvement with StAR has challenged her to think creatively about the complex determinant of health.</p>
<p>In addition Rosie has fundraised for the Ashraya Initiative for Children &ndash; an organisation started by one of her UWC contemporaries in Pune, India, and Food Chain &ndash; an organisation which takes nutritious food to people with HIV in London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible to say how my life might have turned out if I had not been to a UWC! I know that I did not want to study medicine beforehand. Perhaps it was India which helped me to decide that the medical profession was the one for me. I have always had a desire to be involved in international aid work and being at UWC made me aware that I needed some practical skills to be of any use in this field. Inside medicine there are many career paths to be taken and I think UWC has influenced my decision to aim for a career in global health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel that UWC effectively gave me a global social consciousness. I hope I would have achieved this despite a UWC education but I&rsquo;m sure the UWC helped. In my everyday life it makes me think of how my actions impact on the lives of others and theirs on mine. I don&rsquo;t believe I would be half as politically (and otherwise) opinionated if I hadn&rsquo;t had to question and examine and then re-examine all of my opinions and assumptions as a 17 year old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Rosie&rsquo;s favourite UWC memories is the Indian festival of Holi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine 200 students on top of a hill, sunshine a lot of brightly colour paints and a football field. I still have the images painted in my mind of all of us plastered with colours and mud. Pink, purple, orange, green, blue, violet. We even got the headmaster (and his dog) involved. Weeks later the some Scandinavians still had dye in their hair. This was a great day of happiness and complete loss of inhibitions.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>&#39;Although we didn&rsquo;t know what the future held for us when we fled to Kenya, there was a hope and a belief that somewhere there would be a chance to go to school.&#39;</strong></p>
<p>Mario Konyen Joseph (UWCMC 98-00) still can&rsquo;t quite believe that he had the opportunity of a UWC education. &ldquo;Given my background and upbringing, even getting to know about UWC, let alone arriving and studying at one, was highly unlikely,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Mario, who comes from Lorema in southern Sudan, was forced to flee to Kenya as a 12-year-old in 1991 with his brother Olof and cousins James and Peter in order to avoid being conscripted into the rebel Sudan People Liberation Army/Movement.</p>
<p>Many members of his large, extended family died during and after the 21-year war in Southern Sudan &ndash; his father was brutally murdered in a politically-motivated move in 1999 &ndash; and those who are still alive are either in refugee camps in Kenya, living (with minimal education) back in southern Sudan, or scattered around the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although we didn&rsquo;t know what the future held for us when we fled to Kenya, there was a hope and a belief that somewhere there would be a chance to go to school,&rdquo; says Mario. Luckily, that chance presented itself in the form of Sr. Luise-Agonia Radlmeier OP, a Roman Catholic nun from Bavaria, Germany, who has dedicated her life to helping refugees gain an education.</p>
<p>Sr. Luise organised a school place for Mario in Nairobi, and later introduced him to Gilbert Lukhoba of Windle Charitable Trust (now Windle Trust Kenya), a charitable organisation that is also involved in refugee education. Part of its work has included finding opportunities in various UWCs for eligible refugees, and Mario was invited to the selection weekend in Nairobi organised by the Kenya National Committee. He was delighted when he was awarded a place at UWC Mahindra College.</p>
<p>Mario arrived at UWCMC just a year after it opened, and says he knew immediately that he was part of something new and exciting. &ldquo;The whole learning and living environment at UWCMC was engaging and invigorating,&rdquo; he says. However, that brought its own challenges and stresses, with Mario feeling &ldquo;an unwritten responsibility to lay good foundations for the generations to come&rdquo;. He also took time to adjust to his new environment: he had been used to a very strict environment at his school in Nairobi, and found the atmosphere at UWCMC very liberal in comparison. &ldquo;I was a bit baffled by it all at first!&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>However, he soon settled into College life and particularly enjoyed the CAS activity he undertook, working with children and adults with mental health problems and physical disabilities at a Mother Theresa Home in Pune. &ldquo;Without a doubt, UWCMC sorted out a few preconceived ideas about the world and its &lsquo;other&rsquo; inhabitants. It had a profound impact on my life,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>After UWC Mario moved to the UK to study for a BA Hons in Economics with Development Studies at the University of Central Lancashire and a Master&rsquo;s in Development Economics at the University of East Anglia. He now works as Programme Officer for Windle Trust International based in Oxford, UK.</p>
<p>The charity aims to equip refugees affected by conflict in Africa to meet the challenges of development by providing access to education, training and employment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the most unfortunate positions one can find oneself in is to be a refugee anywhere on the African continent,&rdquo; says Mario. &ldquo;What Windle Trust does is not only to give hope but also to equip refugees with lifetime skills and knowledge that can be utilised for the development of their communities and countries when peace is realised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mario has been involved in a number of projects, including one to help set up the William Wilberforce Scholarship Scheme. &ldquo;In conjunction with willing UK universities, this gives disadvantaged African students of outstanding potential the opportunity to acquire the skills and knowledge to address the challenges the continent faces 200 years after the abolition of the slave trade,&rdquo; he explains.</p>
<p>Mario hopes to play a part in rebuilding his own country by one day setting up a &lsquo;Peace &amp; Leadership Foundation&rsquo; in southern Sudan, dedicated to investing at grassroots level in the basic human values of peaceful coexistence, respect, cultural understanding and tolerance, in the hope of producing leaders of tomorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace and tranquillity are prerequisites for economic growth and development," says Mario. "It is my dream to help achieve this."</p>

<p><strong>As a result of my UWC education I take responsibility for the role I play in my society and get involved</strong></p>
<p>Geraldine Paredes Vasquez from Bolivia attended UWC Mahindra College from 1998 to 2000. She currently lives in La Paz, Bolivia where she is studying for a Degree in Law at Universidad Privada Boliviana and is a Founder &amp; Executive Director of W.H.Y Bolivia, an Intercultural Youth Organisation.</p>
<p>Geraldine is also an active volunteer for the UWC National Committee of Bolivia. She was a facilitator at the <a href="http://www.uwc.org/uwc_education/short_programmes/the_netherlands.aspx" target="_blank">Netherlands Youth Leadership Summit</a>(UWC-YLS) in 2007 which resulted in the creation of an alliance to run a Bolivian Youth Intercultural Summit in 2008.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year before going to Mahindra, I wanted to experience new places and new people and went to live in the USA with my grandmother. I liked that experience but felt it was not what I was looking for, and decided I wanted to go abroad on my own. When I saw an ad from United World Colleges in the newspaper I knew I wanted to find out more, so I visited the Committee office and met a recent graduate who let me look through his year book as he talked about his experience. At that moment I knew deep in my heart this was what I was eager to find, I wanted to be a part of UWC and have the chance to live diversity at its fullest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My earlier schooling in Bolivia involved a lot of memorising. I never wrote an essay before UWCMC and the diverse opinions in a class at UWCMC was a very fascinating experience for me, especially in History and Literature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the two years at UWC for me meant much more than just the academics. In Bolivia my earlier schooling was based on a very vertical relationship between teachers and students but at UWC I felt teachers respected the students as equals and gave us the opportunity of being responsible for ourselves. It was a very empowering experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe UWC has influenced deeply in my life choices, and my career and self development in many ways. My university years were very much about getting involved and starting to build my professional life, in and out of the classroom. I need to take a full experience in life, and that means not only to grow academically, but also in community involvement, self awareness, creativity, and other ways. I started studying law in Bolivia, and throughout my time at university I was very active in theatre, arts, and social action as a volunteer. It was through these activities that I discovered my true passion, alternative education. I decided to prioritise my training in this area with the aim of establishing an organisation for intercultural, non formal, peer to peer education focused on peace building, social inclusion, conflict transformation and community leadership in Bolivia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a hard decision to make, but I learned at UWC that to remain authentic and true to yourself is the best way to contribute to development, and that has been my motivation for my actions in life. I chose to follow my dream and I believe having the courage to do so has to do with my years at UWCMC. In 2005 I established Wayna Hila&ntilde;a Yanapa&ntilde;a (W.H.Y Bolivia) in 2005 together with some other UWC graduates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a result of my UWC education I approach life in a positive way regardless of obstacles. I take responsibility for the role I play in my society and get involved, knowing that as part of a community we are constantly influencing each other and inspiring each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;UWC showed me how it feels to choose to celebrate diversity and to be aware that we are all indeed connected, no matter how isolated our reality might look, it has its roots and solutions globally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever people ask me about my life I mention my UWC experience as a new door opening up for me and the UWC Youth Leadership Summit in the Netherlands as a clear reference of the path I chose to follow as an intercultural educator/activist for peace in my country, and perhaps in the Latin American region in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;UWC Mahindra College helped me change my fears into opportunities and struggles into passion,&rdquo; says Ufra. &ldquo;It motivated me to strive for a better, peaceful future; to dare and create an unconventional path that others could walk on too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A graduate of UWCMC (Class of 2005), Ufra lived no ordinary life before coming to the college. What is life like for an adolescent girl from Kashmir who faced brutal consequences of living in a violent society? When your daily life is about facing atrocities, it takes deep courage and determination to not only survive, but overcome what life throws at you as a given.</p>
<p>Ufra is one such fearless individual who rejected the given and moved forward to bring peace in the world. Recognising the need for the healing process from the ongoing conflict in Kashmir, she founded &ldquo;Paigaam: A Message for Peace&rdquo;. This first of its kind organisation started as an education based youth-health peace initiative designed to offer various peace building skills and training-workshops to Kashmiri youth and empower them emotionally, socially and psychologically. Now, Paigaam has grown into an international nonprofit organisation which is currently attempting to redefine the traditional education system in the Kashmir valley by incorporating eclectic peace-education programs in schools, along with their initiatives on arts, and women &amp; youth empowerment.</p>
<p>A peace-psychologist, social entrepreneur, peace activist, and a passionate positive change maker, Ufra is a graduate of Luther College (USA) and the University of Nottingham (UK) with her double degree in Psychology and Mental Health-Wellness. She also holds a Diploma in Leadership Development from the Swedish Institute where she was selected as one of the 30 global fellows in 2013. Originally from Kashmir, her experiences in and passion for positive peace building &amp; human rights led her to formally redefine &amp; pursue the field of peace-psychology. She is currently the youngest &amp; first peace-psychologist in the world and South-Asia.</p>
<p>Born and raised in one of the most conflict-prone regions of the world (Kashmir, India), she always yearned for positive peace building, peaceful co-existence and respect for human rights especially for youth. It is essential but hard to make a positive difference in a place that is marred by extreme violence; innocent Kashmiri youth are constantly facing numerous atrocities and brutalities. But living in different multi-ethnic regions of the world including India, USA and UK strengthened her belief that understanding and acceptance of human rights and peace can create a wider space bringing people, especially youth, together to work for the common good.</p>
<p>When asked what UWC Mahindra College means to her, she fondly remarked, &ldquo;Paigaam&rsquo;s motto is to transform thinking thus transforming lives, and an essential part of it comes from my life-changing experience at UWCMC.&rdquo; Remembering her time at the college, she described how she arrived with no prior expectation of how those 2 years were going to be like, but later realised that it prepared her for the worst things in life with a positive attitude, patience, tolerance and deep understanding of who we are as human beings. &ldquo;I came out of UWCMC with beautiful values, valuable skills, wonderful memories, lifelong friends and a great beginning of an amazing journey of self-transformation,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;UWC Mahindra College helped me realise my purpose in life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whenever I meet fellow Mahindra alumni, we talk about how the experience may have shaped us. These chats are always fun, enlightening and reassuring. It seems to me however, that whoever I talk with, we always come up with the same set of conclusions. First, the experience was intense, and it touched and rocked the core of who we were - and who we are. Second, there is no point in trying to pinpoint how UWCMC affected us. The ways and profoundness of it varies greatly from person to person. Third, despite the fact that the experience actually meant very different things to different people, there is a bond that - perhaps bizarrely- is extremely strong. There was something uniting about those years on the hill, even though when summing it up individually, the narratives are very different.</p>
<p>For me, the two years on the hill put me on a path. I wouldn&acute;t say a *specific* path, but a path nevertheless. I emerged, first devastated at the thought of living life without my friends, but at the same time in constant search for something equally good and meaningful. I chose to study Economics - purely because i was so inspired by my excellent Mahindra teacher, Aseem Shrivastava. And I chose to go to universities which offered an international crowd - again to find some sort of commonality with the hill. As the years went by, and I cannot pinpoint when exactly, I started to realise that of course there is not going to be another Mahindra experience. But there were so many other ones to be had that could be equally good and inspiring. It was not that I let go of Mahindra as a reference point, it was rather that I decided to make my life exciting - not make the context of my life the determinant of whether I was excited! That&acute;s when things sped up.</p>
<p>I have already had a wonderful career, within the NGO-sector, civil service, diplomacy and politics. It is almost frightening to look back, and then reminding myself that I am only 34 - it has only been 15 years since I left Mahindra. What has motivated my choices throughout was an idea that was present in me before Mahindra, but that Mahindra helped me place at the centre of my vision of how my life should be lived. The idea is - social justice is achievable.</p>
<p>After 15 years of charging ahead with this idea in mind, I am now taking a small break. My previous job was to be a Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Norway - in fact, I was the youngest ever Deputy Minister. It was an extremely intense job - and so infinitely privileged. I travelled all the time, and had a toolbox to ensure social justice, that I could only dream of 15 years ago. I met world leaders, and grassroot activist - every day. It was exhilarating. When I left the job at the end of 2013, I was overloaded with extraordinary job-offers. Anything from being an Assistant Secretary General at the United Nations to challenging leadership positions in the private sector. I could have chosen any of those paths and contented on the hectic quest. But I chose otherwise.</p>
<p>I believe that you can have careers, or careers can have you. If you keep charging ahead, you risk being "had". Not stopping to breathe, reconnect and regroup your thoughts will at some point make you a constant runner, and in the end you collapse with exhaustion. I decided to stop and breathe. At the moment I am writing this while my 8 month old son, Edvin, is sleeping in the baby cot beside me. He is my job now. I have dedicated 6 months of my life to be a full-time dad. It is perhaps the most challenging job I have ever had, but it is truly inspiring. In a different way.</p>
<p>Mahindra thought me to value the warmth between humans. It also taught me that this warmth does not just appear, it requires effort. It requires presence, patience and willingness to let yourself be absorbed in others. I think my latest choice to be a full time dad was made possible partly because of this very important lesson from the hill. Whatever will happen after these 6 months? I learnt at Mahindra never to underestimate chance - so I will not guess. However what I do know is that the choice that I will make next in my life is in some way different to what it would have been had I never spent two years on the hill. The imprint of that experience is soul-deep.</p>
