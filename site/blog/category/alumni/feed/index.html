<p><em><strong>A message from the 2019 Reunion Organizers</strong></em>:</p>
<p>Save the Date for Reunion for the Class of 1999! 2 &#8211; 4 August 2019. (All members of the class should have received an email invite. If not, please write to alumni@muwci.net)</p>
<p>In preparation for this amazing weekend, we&#8217;d like to invite class volunteers to be in charge of shaping the event with the Advancement Office’s support so you get the reunion you want! Please indicate the &#8216;Committees&#8217; you’d like to be part of (maximum two, please!) by clicking on the Facebook Poll in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/muwci1999/">Reunion Group</a> or emailing your name to alumni@muwci.net. The time and energy you devote to these tasks are rewarding and a lot of fun!</p>
<p>Descriptions of Volunteer Positions:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #009b90;"><b>Promotions &amp; Registration Savants: </b></span>Inspire everyone to come to Reunion so we have the best reunion attendance possible! Help make sure we&#8217;ve got invitations out to everyone including faculty, coordinate with Usha on RSVPs, nudge people on registrations, encourage classmates to bring happy partners and sticky babies, and most excitingly plan the Wada rooming allotments!</li>
<li><span style="color: #009b90;"><b>Travel Coordinators</b> </span>(Mumbai or Pune-based alumni preferred): aka Arrival/Departure Transport Committee who will support Usha Sundaram with Arrival/Departure Logistics and be the organizational genius behind the amazing traditional Reunion Party Bus to/from Pune.</li>
<li><b><span style="color: #009b90;">Programme &amp; Events Planners</span>: </b>Plan what the weekend will look like with input from our classmates! Do we want a wada concert, football or frisbee, late evening internet hill hike, village drummers or perhaps a mock Fire Service drill? The weekend is an empty canvas!</li>
<li><b><span style="color: #009b90;">Community Engagers</span>: </b>Make this weekend about engaging meaningfully not only with each other but with the extended communities who made our time special at MUWCI. Plan a visit to Sadhana Village? Paud Children&#8217;s Home? Meet the oldest RKHS employees on campus and learn about changes from their perspective? Learn about the work Akshara is doing? Meet the Foundation Programme students from the valley? Plan these opt-in experiences to make this a weekend with greater purpose.</li>

Help plan and design a reunion t-shirt or mug we can share with all reunion attendees and send on request to classmates &amp; faculty who could not make it.</li>
<li><b><span style="color: #009b90;">Reunion Class Gift Organizers</span>: </b>We&#8217;re back after 20 years and a lot of who we are is because of #MUWCI! The entire UWC movement is founded on the concept of philanthropy and we were all benefactors in some way, whether it was scholarships paid by National Committees or this beautiful campus gifted by the Mahindras. <em>This is a time to come back &#8211; and to give back!</em> Can we be the first reunion class to collectively sponsor a scholarship or equivalent fundraising goal? Work with the Advancement Office to understand how our classes can support the college&#8217;s strategic planning &amp; goals, Vision 2022 and commitment to transparency and accountability. Participation matters more than the amount donated and with the Davis IMPACT Match, where your donations are doubled by Shelby Davis, there is no better time to give!</li>
</ul>
<p>We are so looking forward to welcoming you on campus in August! <strong>Questions?</strong> Email Maria or Usha in the Office of Advancement at <a href="mailto:alumni@muwci.net">alumni@muwci.net</a></p>

<p><strong>Tamar Zeevi (center), a MUWCI alumna (Israel, &#8217;15) declared her refusal to enlist in the Israeli army yesterday, for reasons of conscientious objection. Her story made news in various news <a href="http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/i-refuse-to-serve-in-the-israeli-military/">blogs</a> and <a href="http://972mag.com/two-new-army-refuseniks-expected-to-face-israeli-military-prison/123192/">journals</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update #1</strong> (Nov 2016): Tamar and her co-objector have been sentenced to jail time after which they will be brought back for another hearing &amp; possible sentencing &#8211; a cycle which can last for months, as reported by 972 Mag</p>
<p><strong>Update #2</strong> (Feb 2017): Tamar and her co-objectors will be imprisoned for the fifth time this week &#8211; more than 70 days cumulatively since this article was first published. Read a <a href="https://972mag.com/my-sister-is-refusing-to-join-the-idf-and-i-couldnt-be-prouder/125044/">moving account</a> from UWC Mostar alumnus, Amitai Ben-Abba (UWC Mostar &#8217;10) whose sister is amongst Tamar&#8217;s co-objectors</p>
<p>Tamar&#8217;s statement is shared below: </p>
<div style="padding: 12px; background-color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.4;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hi, my name is Tamar Zeevi, I&#8217;m 19 years old and I’m from Jerusalem. I like hiking in Israel and in the world, and I’m interested in sustainability and education. On the 16/11/16, my supposed recruitment date, I will refuse to join the IDF, and choose to pay the price that the army demands that I would pay for my conscience. The choice not to enlist means to take responsibility for my actions and their meaning, drawing a moral line that I&#8217;m not willing to cross, and actively resisting a government and a policy that violates human rights and fueling violent and cruel reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My process of dealing with the recruitment to the army began few years back, around questions about the meaning of serving in the IDF, the duty and the responsibility I carry as an Israeli, and the difficulty towards the IDF’s policies in the occupied territories and the occupation as a whole. I thought a lot about the topic, often talked and consulted friends, teachers and family, and fluctuated a lot between the different arguments, stories and expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">During the last two years of high school I studied abroad in an international school in India (UWCMC), together with friends from around the world, and it was a challenging, enriching and amazing experience. There is no doubt that the distance from Israel has played a meaningful role in the process of questioning the policies in Israel, and mainly taught me that military enrollment is a choice and not necessarily the obvious route. People around me demanded me to critically investigate the reality in my homeland, and in classes I was exposed to texts that planted in me an understanding of my responsibility for this reality, and my power to change it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">On one hand, it is my legal and social duty, the role I was always oriented and expected to perform, and the right to take part in keeping the security of my home and the people who are dear to me. But on the other hand, are a childhood and a life in the shadow of terrorist attacks and wars are real security? What about the safety of people beyond the walls? Am I as a part of the nation that controls their lives also responsible for their safety? Where is the line at which one should stop cooperating, and was it already passed? These questions stirred in me in a hard and difficult way. Sometimes I reacted with defensiveness, and sometimes powerless and frustrated way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">All of this was not enough to convince me to deviate from the expected and the normative route, and the choice to serve in the military was my default. I returned to Israel and started a service year in Sayarut (Green Horizons), the youth movement I was a member of since 6th grade. My years in Sayarut, during which I had explored the landscapes of Israel, tasted its soil and breathed its views, were those that planted in me the feeling that I am the daughter of this land, belong to it and love it. Acclimatizing back in Israel wasn’t easy, and this time, living in this state with more critical eyes, and both international and local points of view, brought back the question of enrollment in a more present and real way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I came to realize that the recruitment is my first and real confrontation with the occupation and the conflict, this is the place, and this is the point in which I choose, Am I willing to take responsibility for the oppression and discrimination that lives on our land? Am I going to take part in the scary system that differentiates between humans, prefers some over others, and feeds the circle of violence, hate and fear? Thus, in one defining moment, I understood that I won&#8217;t. I am not willing to support a situation in which two nations live in fear of each other, and pay such a heavy price for decades. Out of love to the land and to the people who live on it, I want to believe, and believe that there is a different way, and change is possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Fear is the hardest disease that exists in this country. It is horribly contagious, passed from generation to generation, and mainly breeds ugly side effects such as alienation, hatred and violence. The fear’s favorite food item is uncertainty, and in the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel and the IDF make sure that nothing in life is to be taken for granted. Getting up in the morning with fear and going to with it is not a way of life that I am ready to take part in conserving, particularly when the meaning of it is increasing and enlarging the problem itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We will get out of the cycle of fear and violence only when we’ll open our heart and mind, look at what is happening around us, beyond the physical and social walls and let ourselves feel the reality and pain of all the people that this country is their home. Once we all will agree to understand and accept that this is reality, I want to believe that the way of empathy, tolerance and compromise will be our only choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I know, it is a complicated matter, the hatred and the violence in both sides exist and are dangerous, and we shouldn&#8217;t be naive when examining this reality. Nevertheless, we must not forget the hope that it could be better here, we must not accept the acts being done in our name behind the wall of the hiding and separation, and this is my responsibility and yours. There is no one way to change, to be honest, there is an infinity of those, and everyone will chose what they can do for our world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The choice to refuse serving in the Israel Defence Forces is one of the milestones in my path to make life in this homeland life of peace, freedom and fraternity. </span></div>
<div class="gmail_default"> </div>
<div class="gmail_default">MUWCI&#8217;s Global Politics faculty member, Noa Epstein (Israel, UWC Red Cross Nordic &#8217;01), explained that military conscription is obligatory in Israel upon turning 18. &#8220;Tamar made a difficult and, in my opinion, courageous choice.&#8221; Noa wrote to the MUWCI community, &#8220;The amount of peer pressure and social costs she will face in Israel are significant.&#8221; </div>
<div class="gmail_default"> </div>
<div class="gmail_default">As an Israeli, Noa also faced conscription when she graduated from UWC Red Cross Nordic 15 years ago, but was able to abstain on the basis of being recognized as a conscientious objector. She describes military service as something that is a forgone conclusion for young Israelis, since serving their country by becoming a soldier was an expectation placed on all from early childhood. </div>
<div class="gmail_default"> </div>
<div class="gmail_default">Noa sent Tamar&#8217;s statement to all our students with her own message below: </div>
<blockquote>
<div class="gmail_default"><em>As you read Tamar&#8217;s refusal statement  I encourage you to think about the question of becoming a solider. For some of you it is mandatory, for others voluntary. But as UWC grads, I hope you will make informed choices in life; ones that you have thoroughly and critically thought about. That is not to imply that all soldiers are bad. The people I love most in this world have served in the Israeli army and I do not view all soldiers as evil people. But to my mind there is something that is structurally fundamentally wrong with sending 18 year old kids to sacrifice 2-3 golden years (or even their life) for the continuation of Israeli occupation over the Palestinian people and lands. Israel has a right to exist as a nation state and home for the Jewish people and the non Jewish minorities within, but the Israeli army is more engaged today with deepening the occupation than with promoting what I understand to be Israel&#8217;s national interest: a viable peaceful future alongside the Palestinians.</em> </div>
</blockquote>
<div class="gmail_default">As the MUWCI community discusses Tamar&#8217;s actions and engages with their faculty member on her own experiences, UWC&#8217;s role as an educational institution comes into sharp focus. Both Tamar and Noa ascribe their UWC experience &#8212; of being encouraged to question, think critically, develop empathy and fundamentally believe that one person&#8217;s action do contribute towards change &#8212; as a fundamental influencer in their acts of conscientious objection. From our place on the hill, we wish Tamar, and other young people like her, strength in the difficult task of acting on their beliefs. </div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Remembering Saaniya Jairath, India, &#8217;06</strong> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="http://uwcmahindracollege.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Saanu.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1699 size-medium alignright" src="http://uwcmahindracollege.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Saanu-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>On March 12th, 2016, Saaniya Jairath, or Saanu to many of us, passed away after almost a yearlong battle with cancer. Saaniya graduated from UWC Mahindra College in 2006 and went on to study Economics at Carleton College graduating in 2010. While working at Ernst &amp; Young in Minneapolis she completed her Master’s in Business Administration from The Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota. </em></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">Born on the First of April, 1988 Saaniya captured the essence of April Fool’s Day &#8211; everyday! She was fun, lively, and never hesitant to call your bluff, the life of a party and had reserves of energy that could light up a city. Saaniya was one of the first few people I met at MUWCI. Our journey started at Orientation Week and rehearsals for the First Year Show. We were to jive to <em>Jailhouse Rock </em>for the amusement of our co years and Second Years. Rehearsals were hilarious for her and embarrassing for me. My two left feet and all-boys-boarding-school awkwardness added to the chaos. Saaniya would patiently take me through the steps over and over again till I got it right; the entire time controlling her laughter and the urge to make fun of me. I still have two left feet and the all-boys-boarding-school awkwardness has worn off substantially &#8211; or so I think. However, Saaniya will always be the first girl I ever danced with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As teenagers we loved dearly and fought bitterly. Exactly a year from our Jailhouse jive we were drafted to dance in the Second Year show. On the first night of rehearsal our friends had sensed we were not on talking terms and decided not to pair us together. I had struggled throughout rehearsal with my assigned partner and refused to look in Saaniya’s direction to see how she was doing. After rehearsal I went up to her, it was apparent she had been watching my failed attempts. Without letting me get half a sentence in she said in a half-cheeky half matter-of-fact tone, “Hormuz, if you say you are sorry, I’ll be your partner for the show.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Saaniya’s energy, enthusiasm and love for life were never lost on me. If there was one way to describe her, I’d say she always had a twinkle in her eyes. She loved her friends immensely and was extremely loyal. She had a way of brightening up your day from thousands of miles away. On a fundraising website set up in her memory, someone had left a quote that perfectly describes how Saaniya wanted to be remembered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>&#8220;Remember me with smiles and laughter, for that is how I&#8217;ll remember you all. If you can only remember me with tears, then don&#8217;t remember me at all.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A couple of years ago, I visited Saaniya and her family in her hometown of Calcutta, an experience I’ll never forget. For as long as I live, Calcutta will always evoke the fondest memories of Saaniya. Showing me her favourite parts of the city meant a lot to her. She was caring and thoughtful in so many ways. Every day was meticulously planned so I’d enjoy being in her city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was never a dull moment when you were around Saaniya. No time for being sad, unhappy or ungrateful. She taught us to enjoy every minute. She taught one of us to jive and all of us to love life. So until we meet again in another life, keep watching over us, remind us to laugh at the smallest of things and save me a dance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1424" src="http://uwcmahindracollege.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SRC_Lecture.jpg" alt="SRC_Lecture" width="1500" height="994" /></p>
<p>Nothing that I do today would have been possible without MUWCI. I am not the most stellar of students, and was going through the motions in the Indian school system. I got accepted to MUWCI, and started studying a wide variety of subjects and reading a lot more. While my academic brilliance didn&#8217;t (still hasn&#8217;t, and most likely will never) manifest itself, I did find myself engaged in a wide variety of avenues of study that still continue to inform my work in graduate school and in my art practice.</p>
<p>After MUWCI, I went to College of Idaho to study Art. After graduating with a Major in Art, I enrolled into the National Museum Institute in New Delhi,​ where I am currently​ studying Art Conservation. Frankly, I was lucky in that I found what I wanted to do in life, in MUWCI&#8217;s art classes with Nandu. I am still working at my own personal projects in photography, and in addition, working in the field of art conservation, which is tremendously exciting. Getting to handle and study the great works of art in museums, archives and in the field, up close and personal is exhilarating.</p>
<p>MUWCI was the first place where I got to working with my hands. I started making (very crude) musical instruments and Ben and Parag were constant sources of (very unwarranted, but welcome) encouragement. I moved on to working with photography and sculpture. Eventually in Idaho, I ended up involved in the classic car scene, photographing and working on cars made before my parents were born. I also got to learning banjo and bass and playing for a country and bluegrass band. Soon after, I began working with historic cameras and techniques long obsolete, which is what I do now in graduate school and for my personal work. I imagine I wouldn&#8217;t be doing any of those things if not for MUWCI.</p>
<p>I still remember year long seminars in Marxism and Post-Modernism with Cyrus, Usha, Hartman, Urmila, Michael and other teachers and classmates. I cannot claim to have understood a fraction of what was going on, but what I did manage to figure out has done me much good in how I look at the world. MUWCI threw me in a multicultural environment with remarkable freedom. For a 17-year-old boy who grew up in the prim and proper Indian school, it was a culture shock. But it prepared me for the four years in Idaho, and even more so, the last year and a half in Delhi. Most importantly, I learnt (mostly because of my chequered academic and disciplinary record) that it is okay to mess up once in a while, as long as you learn from it and don&#8217;t repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>I reckon I am fairly adaptable and would end up doing okay for myself in life, but I would definitely have done a lot worse for myself if I didn&#8217;t end up in MUWCI.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve moved beyond Excel sheets to relationship management in the cloud! This means that we can now manage your info more systematically, which will make communication so much easier and relevant. We know you&#8217;ve done this before, but please fill out your details <a href="http://bit.ly/1OuR1h6">here</a> one last time (we promise, we will only ask for updates only once a year :)) so that we can send you relevant updates and details about alumni events, mentorship opportunities and networking occasions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alumni Hubs</strong> </p>
<p>We are all set to launch MUWCI alumni hubs! Some have already been up and going, but now we are fully geared up to rock New York, Boston, London, Delhi, and Bombay. We are looking to organise at least two events in the coming months with all of you. Join your hub today.  </p>

<p><strong>Mentor Students</strong></p>
<p>We are excited to begin a mentorship programme that will enable much needed interaction between our current MUWCI lovelies and you. We&#8217;ve identified six career focus areas to begin with and are looking for alumni to share their expertise and trace their professional paths into these fields after MUWCI. Using video conferencing we&#8217;ll initiate focused panel discussions on each of these areas over the course of this year for interested students and alumni to attend or participate in online. Please write to us at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">communications@muwci.net</span> to join a panel or nominate a peer doing interesting work in these fields. We will be focusing on the following interest areas in the coming months:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UWCMC, in its dreams and idealism, is sometimes vulnerable to what Chiamanda Adichie calls “the single story.” Indeed, stories around impact in communities around us do present a rosier picture than most would agree. A single story of triumph emerges from the multitude of tales of struggle, challenge and discovery.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seemacircle.com/">Seema Circle</a> is an initiative that tells a deeper story of impact. In Seema, women from the Kolvan and Mulshi valleys learn to make and sell paper jewellery. Started by Alisha Fredriksson (UWCMC, Class of 2014), it has gone through its own triumphs and failures, conveying valuable lessons for the UWCMC community.</p>
<p>The genesis of Seema Circle lies in Alisha’s early passion as a jewellery designer. “Before coming to UWCMC, I had a small business for selling jewellery”, says Alisha. When she saw the Akshara Mela in 2012, she was surprised by the use of paper in the earrings they were selling. She began experimenting with paper jewellery designs and exploring the idea of sharing her passion to connect with women from the valley. And so Seema was born: an initiative that connected communities with a common thread: jewellery-making.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Story of the Circle </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Video Courtesy: Daan de Kruijf (UWCMC, Class of &#8217;15)</span></p>
<p>One thing led to another, as she first trained a group of women from the nearby 8-9 villages in jewellery making skills. Rapidly, centres in numerous villages such as Asade were established where village women made paper jewellery. Seema was flying high as it made its first sales in December 2013.</p>
<p>Its reach wasn’t just limited to its sales. Seema began to be an important part of the women’s lives as they not only absorbed techniques of design but also those of teaching and leadership. Alisha says, “I worked with the first batch of women every day and taught them jewellery-making techniques. They became the ‘master-trainers’ and taught these techniques to other women.”</p>
<p>“Then things got a bit more challenging”. Realising that Seema would need a more concerted, long term focus, Alisha set up systems in place, delegating responsibilities to her first years. But it wasn’t as smooth sailing from then on. “Everyone got very busy”: Seema, was stung by a lack of consistent involvement. Eventually, it started to dissolve at the end of last year.</p>
<p><a href="http://uwcmahindracollege.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1913203_10152716202516830_5861603131982904769_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1333" src="http://uwcmahindracollege.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1913203_10152716202516830_5861603131982904769_o-150x150.jpg" alt="Alisha" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Alisha (UWCMC, Class of &#8217;14)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Founder of Seema Circle</span></p>
<p>The story, however, has taken a happy turn as Alisha has already made plans for Seema’s reboot. “I considered everything from completely shutting it down to making it a full-fledged global business.” She has settled on the middle ground, handing much of the responsibility to (coincidentally) Seema, from the Akshara office, whose rise through the ranks has paralleled Seema Circle’s rise. “Seema is a really enterprising woman who wants to learn.”Also, Alisha’s own experiences as a founding student at the <a href="https://www.minerva.kgi.edu/">Minerva Schools at KGI</a> are significantly contributing toward reimagining Seema. “In the first year of classes, I was always thinking about what we learned in terms of a Seema context.” After a long ride of sharp highs and lows, Seema Circle is heading towards a stable and sustainable structure.  </p>
<p>Today Alisha is more experienced, better and stronger due to her journey with Seema and is looking to make it count. “If you’re not careful, you can set out to make a positive impact, but end up causing disappointment or harm  on the communities you work with. Eventually, I want Seema to be what the women want Seema to be.” Seema thus embodies a vital message for the UWCMC community: that impact is not only a story of success and idealism but also one of relentlessness, sensitivity and the wisdom to let go.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>When people are accused of crimes and are too poor to afford a lawyer, my office represents them. I am an attorney at the Atlanta Judicial Circuit, Office of the Public Defender. I do this work because I believe that everyone has the right to a lawyer, and that no matter what you have been accused of doing (murder, armed robbery, child molestation) you have the right to make the government prove the case against you and in doing so, you should have a zealous and passionate lawyer who will represent you and fight for you and your rights. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>After UWC Mahindra College, I had a wonderful four years at Wellesley College in Massachusetts where I got a great education. I majored in English and French and studied abroad in Paris and Senegal. I also did a summer internship at The Hague where I observed and learned from the trial of Slobodan Milosevic. After that, I spent a year in the West Indies on a Watson Fellowship where I lived with host families and learned Creole. Then I attended law school at Emory University in Atlanta from where I graduated in 2008.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For the past 7 years, I have been a public defender which is a job I love and gives me a great sense of purpose. UWC instilled in me a strong sense of personal and social responsibility and in this job I have found a way to use my privilege to advocate for those on the margins of power. </div>

		<description><![CDATA[Jyotsna (UWCMC, '04) has been living the UWC mission by managing health-based projects focused on larger goals of economic growth and poverty alleviation in the international development sector. Read more to find out how.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/116330936?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/116330936">Nigeria Neglected Diseases &#8211; An Interview with Joey Shivanandan</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/chancerproductions">Chancer Productions</a> </p>
<p>Jyotsna’s main focus of work revolves around increasing access and availability of drugs and medical supplies in developing countries through supply chain strengthening and capacity building of governments and local organisations. An example of the projects she manages concerns the control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in the highly volatile region of Northern Nigeria. </p>
<p>Through mass drug administration, capacity building of state and local governments and raising public awareness, the project aims to curb the spread of these diseases that cause loss of livelihood, disfigurement, stigma, disability and poverty. Jyotsna acts as Project Manager for this 3 year project (project completes in Oct 2016) and manages a team of technical experts on the ground. Through their efforts, the project has managed to distribute over 6 million NTDs treatments and train over 5,000 community health workers and teachers. Jyotsna spoke about the importance of control of NTDs at the UN headquarters in Copenhagen at the Global Health Summit in 2014.</p>
<p>For the past 6 years, Jyotsna has worked with Crown Agents based in the UK on a wide array of projects towards larger goals of economic growth and poverty alleviation. She worked on and managed projects in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Swaziland, Nigeria, Burma and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>UWC Mahindra College has played a pivotal role in influencing Jyotsna’s life choices, including career path. It was through the curriculum, her teacher’s influence and most importantly her peers, that Jyotsna was introduced to critical thinking, challenging the status quo and contributions to community development. UWC Mahindra College played a seminal role in shaping Jyotsna’s ideas on how she wants to engage and contribute meaningfully to the communities she is a part of.</p>
<p>After graduating from UWC Mahindra College in 2004, Jyotsna went on to study politics at Whitman College in Washington state and then International Management at King’s College London. Both the degrees were relevant to her pursuit to work in the international development sector.</p>
<p>Another example of her work is her involvement on the British Government’s response to the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone. This project helped set up and operationalise all seven Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs)in Sierra Leone. Jyotsna’s role on the project is generating and analysing vital data to ensure the all the ETCs never experience a “stock out” as that could result in the loss of lives,  In total, the project sourced <strong>a catalogue of 1,358 items, including drugs, personal protection equipment crucial for ETC workers, laboratory supplies, infrastructure etc. </strong> – all of which have been vital in the fight against the disease. And the proof of its impact is in the figures: at the peak of the outbreak in November 2014, more than 500 cases of Ebola were being confirmed in Sierra Leone every week – now that figure has dropped to as low as just three cases in a week. Sierra Leone is working towards zero cases of Ebola by August 2015 and through her team and her effort’s, Jyotsna is going to be continuing to help them achieve that.</p>
